# Changelog

## v0.2.1

- Removed some code made redundant by TDW v1.7
- Fixed: Controllers automatically launch the build (which doesn't work on headless servers).

## v0.2.0

- Updated documentation for TDW public release.
  - Expanded system requirements section.
- Updated URLs custom model libraries to TDW v1.6 URLs.

## v0.1.1

### Controllers

- `squishing.py`: In trials in which one object is dropped onto another, the "dropped" object is a solid object instead of a squishy cloth object.

## v0.1.2

- Added optional `launch_build` parameter to each controller constructor.
