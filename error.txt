The build quit due to an error. Check the build log for more info.
If the build is on the same machine as this controller, the log path is probably /Users/honglinchen/Library/Logs/MIT/TDW/Player.log
If the build is on a remote Linux server, the log path is probably ~/.config/unity3d/MIT/TDW/Player.log (where ~ is your home directory)
